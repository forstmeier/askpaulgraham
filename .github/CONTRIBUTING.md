# Contributing

> Working on the code 💻

The `askpaulgraham` **Contributing** guidelines follow three basic rules.

1. Run `gofmt` and `golint` on all submitted code.  
2. Add or update all unit tests to get as close to 100% coverage as possible.  
3. Commit messages should a single line without punctuation and a 50 character max.  

Any questions on these can be opened as an Issue with the `question` label.

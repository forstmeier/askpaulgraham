## About :sunglasses:

`askpaulgraham` is a for-fun side project using [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/) and [Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/). Both the **question** and **summaries** features are powered by GPT-3 and may not necessarily provide output that reflects Paul Graham's opinions.  

:warning: This project is open source but only intended to have a single instance running for users to play with.

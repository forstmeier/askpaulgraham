## About :sunglasses:

`askpaulgraham` is a for-fun side project using [OpenAI's GPT-3](https://openai.com/) and [Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/). Both the **question** and **summaries** features are powered by GPT-3 and may not necessarily provide output that reflects Paul Graham's opinions.  

:warning: This project is open source but only intended to have a single instance running for users to play with.  

Feel free to reach out via direct message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/forstmeier).  

The frontend is hosted on [Cyclic](https://www.cyclic.sh/) and the backend is hosted on AWS using SAM.  

## Contribute :zany_face:

Fork this repository and open a [pull request](https://github.com/forstmeier/askpaulgraham/pulls) for code changes or submit an [issue](https://github.com/forstmeier/askpaulgraham/issues) if you spot a bug.  

On the frontend, any improvements to the style, UX, or functionality are welcome. For backend code improvements, I'd definitely appreciate improvements to the OpenAI API requests. Be sure to follow Go best practices! :tada:
